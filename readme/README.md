MY PORTFOLIO
_____________

This is a portfolio that contains information about me, such as a brief introduction to myself, my abilities, and my accomplishments. You can notice in my portfolio that I've included a small animation of my design. It can be displayed in a unique way using the animation.

Ohh! I've also applied border-radius and border-shadow to make my photographs and titles appear to be more prettier and more appealing.



---Design Process---

My initial desired design is, there will have motion as well as a stunning color font. However, while doing so, I changed a lot of my ideas since it's difficult to implement because it requires a lot of knowledge. As a result, I focused on the border-radius graphics and the text decoration .

This webpage is for recruiters to look at so they can take me into consideration. When people look at my portfolio, they will notice that I have included my skills, background, and accomplishments, since I believe that skills and experiences are extremely important once we enter society.

On my portfolio website, I have assigned a certain color for a specific section for a number of reasons, one of which is to allow individuals reading or browsing my page to have a better view and find it simpler to explore.


---Features---

To begin, when you click on a section that you want to view in my personal portfolio header, there is an animation with a 2-3 second motion to get you to the section, as well as a scroll bar at the right to allow users to scroll anytime they want. Second, I have an animation with my text typing, which I have set at a speed that allows users to clearly read the text. Moving on, each area has an arrow button that users may use to move to the next section, or they can use the scroll bar. Furthermore, on my skills page, there is a "ReadMore" button that takes the user to a new page where they can read my personal thoughts on the skills. After then, there is a small motion for my accomplishment to go to the next page. I've adjusted the motion speed to a fairly comfortable level so that people don't get the impression that it's moving too slowly or too quickly. There is also a square bar for pages that users may click on to get a better view. Next, there is a contact button, if somebody wants to send me a message, that button will bring them to the contact page, where they can quickly send me a message. Finally, I have a logo square box that, when clicked, it takes the user to my page, such as Instagram, Facebook, or Linkein.



---Technologies Used---

style.css

CSS has helped me in the styling and layout of web sites such as changing the font, color, size, and spacing of your text, break it into numerous columns, or add animations and other visual elements.


style.js

Javascript has helped me in the design of my website by allowing me to create unique effects and perform actions to interact with visitors.

cdnjs is a free and open-source software that I use to get library sources example the icons.


https://code.jquery.com

Jquery is quite beneficial, and it assisted me with the animation.
